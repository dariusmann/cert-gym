        <h1>Understanding Your Accuracy Rate Score</h1>
        <p>In our commitment to offering comprehensive tools for tracking your progress on our RBT (Registered Behaviour
            Technician) learning platform, we introduce the "Accuracy Rate Score." This component of your tracking
            dashboard offers insight into your performance over the most recent set of practice questions. Below is a
            detailed explanation of what the Accuracy Rate Score is, how it is calculated, and its significance.</p>

        <h2>What is the Accuracy Rate Score?</h2>
        <p>The Accuracy Rate Score represents the percentage of questions you have answered correctly out of the last
            100 questions you have attempted. This score provides a snapshot of your current performance, focusing
            specifically on your recent interactions with our practice exams. It's a dynamic measure that updates as you
            answer more questions, reflecting your latest learning achievements and areas needing attention.</p>

        <h2>How is the Accuracy Rate Score Calculated?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Selection of Questions</strong>: The score is based on your most recent 100 questions across all
                task list categories. This approach ensures that the score reflects your current knowledge and
                understanding.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Calculating Correct Answers</strong>: We count the number of questions you answered correctly
                within this set of 100 questions.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Determining the Score</strong>: The Accuracy Rate Score is then calculated by dividing the
                number of correct answers by 100, the total number of questions considered. This result is presented as
                a percentage.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Significance of Your Accuracy Rate Score</h2>
        <p>The Accuracy Rate Score serves as an immediate reflection of your learning progress. Here's how to interpret
            and use this score:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A Measure of Current Performance</strong>: It shows how well you are grasping the material right
                now, allowing you to see improvements or identify areas that may require more focus.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feedback for Focused Study</strong>: By reflecting your recent performance, the score can help
                you tailor your study strategy. Areas where your accuracy is lower might benefit from additional review
                or practice.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Learning Indicator</strong>: As you continue to answer more questions, your Accuracy
                Rate Score will update, providing you with ongoing feedback about your learning journey.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            offers immediate, actionable feedback on your recent performance, helping you identify strengths and areas
            for improvement. As you engage with our learning materials and practice exams, keep an eye on this score to
